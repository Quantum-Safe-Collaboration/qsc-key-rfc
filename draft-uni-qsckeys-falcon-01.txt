                      Quantum Safe keys for FALCON
                          draft-uni-qsckeys-01

Abstract

   This proposal defines key management approaches for Quantum Safe
   Cryptographic (QSC) algorithms currently under evaluation in the NIST
   Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) process.  This includes key
   identification, key serialization, and key compression.  The purpose
   is to provide guidance such that the adoption of quantum-safe
   algorithms is not hampered with the fragmented evolution of necessary
   key management standards.  Early definition of key material standards
   will help expedite the adoption of new quantum safe algorithms at the
   same time as improving interoperability between implementations and
   minimizing divergence across standards.

1.  Introduction

   QSC algorithms being standardized in the NIST PQC Process have
   evolved through several rounds and iterations.  Keys are neither
   easily identifiable nor compatible across rounds.  It is also
   expected that algorithms will evolve after final candidates have been
   selected.  The lack of binary compatibility between algorithm
   versions and variants means that it is important to clearly identify
   key material.  Parallel to the NIST process, industry is evaluating
   the impact of adopting new PQC algorithms, in particular key

   management.  Here it is important to define and standardize key
   serialization and encoding formats.  Finally, we have seen that many
   platforms and protocols are very constrained when it comes to the
   amount of memory or space available for key objects.  This makes it
   important to define and standardize key compression formats.  This
   proposal addresses aspects of key identification, key serialization,
   and key compression for NIST PQC candidates.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] .

1.2.  Algorithm Identification

   Algorithm identification is important for several reasons:

   *  Managing a smooth transition from early adoption algorithm
      versions to production versions where there is no compatibility.
   *  Supporting different algorithm versions from different NIST rounds
   *  Identifying different key serialization strategies
   *  Identifying compressed and uncompressed keys

   The current standardization of quantum-safe algorithms does not
   address the definition of serialization structures for keys.  As a
   result, it has become commonplace for the cryptographic community
   working on and with these algorithms to define their own approaches.
   This leads to proprietary and internal representations for key
   material.  This has certain advantages in terms of ease of
   experimentation while focusing on finding the best-performing QSC
   algorithms.  In terms of longer-term support where algorithm versions
   change this is a problem.  For the purpose of temporarily supporting
   ongoing experimentation with opaque blobs, for example in simple
   "classic key-emulating" test applications, such as TLS, this document
   specifies a temporary but suboptimal key format in section 2.1,
   mainly to establish a base of reference for as long as
   experimentation is ongoing.  This is referenced as the 'raw key
   material' representation.  At the same time, this proposal documents
   in section 2.2 below, a long-term key representation format useful to
   address the goals outlined in 1.1.  This proposal contains all
   information required to document and transition from one version of
   key material representation to another.

1.3.  Algorithm and Algorithm Parameter Object Identifier

   Algorithm and algorithm parameter information shall have ASN.1 type
   AlgorithmIdentifier as given in [RFC5280] and shall be extended by an
   pqcAlgorithmParameterName type in the optional parameters field:


   AlgorithmIdentifier ::=  SEQUENCE {
       algorithm  OBJECT IDENTIFIER, - OID: algorithm and algo parameter
       parameters pqcAlgorithmParameterName OPTIONAL
   }
   pqcAlgorithmParameterName ::= PrintableString


2.  Overview of PQC algorithm and parameter OIDs

   Each PQC algorithm has its own specific parameters.  Different
   parameter sets provide different levels of security within one
   algorithm.  This memo attributes a name and an OID to the different
   security level NIST round 3 parameter sets.  The following table
   gives an overview of the possible OIDs in the algorithm field and
   possible parameters set names in the parameters field of the
   AlgorithmIdentifier type.  Each name or OID represents a single
   parameter set of given security.  Details can be found in the
   individual PQC algorithm chapters.

2.1.  Key Formats

   The private key format defined is from PKCS#8 [RFC5208] .  PKCS#8
   PrivateKeyInfo is defined as:

Internet-Draft             QSC Keys for FALCON               August 2022


   PrivateKeyInfo ::=  SEQUENCE {
       version               INTEGER             -- PKCS#8 syntax ver
       privateKeyAlgorithm   AlgorithmIdentifier -- see chapter above
       privateKey            OCTET STRING,       -- see chapter below
       attributes            [0]  IMPLICIT Attributes OPTIONAL
   }


   Distributing a PQC private key requires a PKCS#8 PrivateKeyInfo with
   a joined PQC algorithm and algorithm parameter OID in the algorithm
   field of AlgorithmIdentifier and a PQC algorithm specific private key
   object in the privateKey field of PrivateKeyInfo.  Both objects are
   defined in the specific algorithm sections of this document.  For an
   overview see tables above and below.

2.2.  Public Key Format based on [RFC5280]

   RFC5280 subjectPublicKeyInfo is defined in as:


   SubjectPublicKeyInfo := SEQUENCE {
       algorithm          AlgorithmIdentifier  -- see chapter above
       subjectPublicKey   BIT STRING           -- see chapter below
   }


   Distributing a PQC public key requires a [RFC5480]
   subjectPublicKeyInfo with a joined PQC algorithm and algorithm
   parameter OID in the algorithm field of AlgorithmIdentifier and a PQC
   algorithm specific public key object in the subjectPublicKey field of
   subjectPublicKeyInfo.  Both objects are defined in the specific
   algorithm sections of this document.  For an overview see tables
   above and below.

2.3.  Overview of Memo Definitions - PQC Key Formats

   The privateKey field in the PrivateKeyInfo type [RFC5480] is an OCTET
   STRING whose contents are the value of the private key.  The
   interpretation of the content differs from PQC algorithm to
   algorithm.  The subjectPublicKey field in the subjectPublicKeyInfo
   type RFC 5480 [RFC5480] is a BIT STRING whose contents are the value
   of the public key.  Here also the interpretation of the content
   differs from PQC algorithm to algorithm.

   For an NTRU private key, for example, the content needs to be
   interpreted according to the NTRUPrivateKey type and for an NTRU
   public key the content needs to be interpreted according to the
   NTRUPublicKey type; both are defined in the NTRU chapter below.

3.2.  Key Details

   The FALCON private key contains the key components f, g and F.  Each
   coefficient of f and g is encoded over a fixed number of bits, which
   depends on the degree of f and g: 6 bits each for degree 512
   (parameter name = falcon512-r3) and 5 bits each for degree 1024
   (parameter name = falcon1024-r3).  Coefficients of F use 8 bits each,
   regardless of its degree.  Each coefficient uses signed encoding,
   with two's complement for negative values.  Moreover, the minimal
   value is forbidden, e.g. when using degree 512, the valid range for a
   coefficient of f or g is -31 to +31; -32 is not allowed.

3.3.  Private Key Full Encoding

   Encoding a FALCON private key with PKCS#8 must include the following
   two fields:

   *  falcon-(degree)-r3 in the algorithm field of AlgorithmIdentifier
   *  FALCONPrivateKey in the privateKey field, which is an OCTET
      STRING.

   When a FALCON public key is included in the distributed
   PrivateKeyInfo, the PublicKey field in FALCONPrivateKey is used (see
   description of FALCONPublicKey below).  ASN.1 Encoding for a FALCON
   private key:

3.4.  Public Key Full Encoding

   The FALCON public key contains a series of coefficients encoded into
   parameter h.  Each coefficient of h is encoded as a 14 bit sequence
   (since q = 12289, 14 bits per coefficient are used).  Coefficients
   are then concatenated.  The final bit string is zero padded to fit
   into a byte sequence.

6.  Security Considerations

   Any processing of the ASN.1 private key structures, such as base64
   en/decoding shall be performed in "constant-time", meaning without
   secret-dependent control flow and table lookups.  The ASN.1
   structures in this document are defined with fixed tag-lengths.  The
   purpose is to prevent side-channel leakage of variable lengths during
   DER parsing.  Any DER parsing of the private key ASN.1 key structures
   shall be performed with these fixed lengths.
