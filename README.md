# qsc-key-rfc
collborative environment for developing a QS key serialization document / RFC

The pre-standardisation phase of quantum safe cryptography is a wild west in terms key serialisation formats. Key persistence was not a requirement of the NIST process and as such formats were not specified. 

This complicates interoperability testing, hampers a managed migration through evolving versions of the algorithms and complicates the analysis of the impact that complicated QS keys have on systems and protocols.

This document is an open effort to address this situation
