               Quantum Safe Cryptography Key Information
                       draft-uni-qsckeys-kyber-00

Abstract

   This proposal defines key management approaches for the Quantum Safe
   Cryptographic (QSC) algorithm CRYSTALS-Kyber which has been selected
   for standardization by the NIST Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC)
   process.  This includes key identification, key serialization, and
   key compression.  The purpose is to provide guidance such that the
   adoption of quantum-safe algorithms is not hampered with the
   fragmented evolution of necessary key management standards.  Early
   definition of key material standards will help expedite the adoption
   of new quantum safe algorithms at the same time as improving
   interoperability between implementations and minimizing divergence
   across standards.

1.  Introduction

   QSC algorithms being standardized in the NIST PQC Process have
   evolved through several rounds and iterations.  Keys are neither
   easily identifiable nor compatible across rounds.  It is also
   expected that algorithms will evolve after final candidates have been
   selected.  The lack of binary compatibility between algorithm
   versions and variants means that it is important to clearly identify
   key material.  Parallel to the NIST process, industry is evaluating

   the impact of adopting new PQC algorithms, in particular key
   management.  Here it is important to define and standardize key
   serialization and encoding formats.  Finally, we have seen that many
   platforms and protocols are very constrained when it comes to the
   amount of memory or space available for key objects.  This makes it
   important to define and standardize key compression formats.  This
   proposal addresses aspects of key identification, key serialization,
   and key compression for NIST PQC candidates.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] .

1.2.  Algorithm Identification

   Algorithm identification is important for several reasons:

   *  Managing a smooth transition from early adoption algorithm
      versions to production versions where there is no compatibility.
   *  Supporting different algorithm versions from different NIST rounds
   *  Identifying different key serialization strategies
   *  Identifying compressed and uncompressed keys

   The current standardization of quantum-safe algorithms does not
   address the definition of serialization structures for keys.  As a
   result, it has become commonplace for the cryptographic community
   working on and with these algorithms to define their own approaches.
   This leads to proprietary and internal representations for key
   material.  This has certain advantages in terms of ease of
   experimentation while focusing on finding the best-performing QSC
   algorithms.  In terms of longer-term support where algorithm versions
   change this is a problem.  This proposal defines in section 2 a long-
   term structured key representation format useful to address the goals
   outlined in 1.2.

1.3.  Algorithm and Algorithm Parameter Object Identifier

   Algorithm and algorithm parameter information shall have ASN.1 type
   AlgorithmIdentifier as given in [RFC5280] and shall be extended by an
   pqcAlgorithmParameterName type in the optional parameters field:

       algorithm  OBJECT IDENTIFIER, - OID: algorithm and algo parameter
       parameters pqcAlgorithmParameterName OPTIONAL
   }
   pqcAlgorithmParameterName ::= PrintableString


2.  Overview of CRYSTALS-Kyber and parameter OIDs

   CRYSTALS-Kyber consists of six different parameter sets.  This memo
   attributes a name and a placeholder for an OID to the different
   parameter sets of CRYSTALS-Kyber.  The following table gives an
   overview of the possible OIDs in the algorithm field and possible
   parameters set names in the parameters field of the
   AlgorithmIdentifier type.  Each name or OID represents a single
   parameter set of given security.  Details can be found in the next
   section.

2.1.  Key Formats

   The private key format defined is from PKCS#8 [RFC5208] .  PKCS#8
   PrivateKeyInfo is defined as:

Internet-Draft      QSC Cryptography Key Information      September 2022


   PrivateKeyInfo ::=  SEQUENCE {
       version               INTEGER             -- PKCS#8 syntax ver
       privateKeyAlgorithm   AlgorithmIdentifier -- see chapter above
       privateKey            OCTET STRING,       -- see chapter below
       attributes            [0]  IMPLICIT Attributes OPTIONAL
   }


   Distributing a PQC private key requires a PKCS#8 PrivateKeyInfo with
   a joined PQC algorithm and algorithm parameter OID in the algorithm
   field of AlgorithmIdentifier and a PQC algorithm specific private key
   object in the privateKey field of PrivateKeyInfo.  Both objects are
   defined in the specific algorithm sections of this document.  For an
   overview see tables above and below.

2.2.  Public Key Format based on [RFC5280]

   RFC5280 subjectPublicKeyInfo is defined in as:


   SubjectPublicKeyInfo := SEQUENCE {
       algorithm          AlgorithmIdentifier  -- see chapter above
       subjectPublicKey   BIT STRING           -- see chapter below
   }


   Distributing a PQC public key requires a [RFC5480]
   subjectPublicKeyInfo with a joined PQC algorithm and algorithm
   parameter OID in the algorithm field of AlgorithmIdentifier and a PQC
   algorithm specific public key object in the subjectPublicKey field of
   subjectPublicKeyInfo.  Both objects are defined in the specific
   algorithm sections of this document.  For an overview see tables
   above and below.

2.3.  Overview of Memo Definitions - PQC Key Formats

   The privateKey field in the PrivateKeyInfo type [RFC5480] is an OCTET
   STRING whose contents are the value of the private key.  The
   interpretation of the content differs from PQC algorithm to
   algorithm.  The subjectPublicKey field in the subjectPublicKeyInfo
   type RFC 5480 [RFC5480] is a BIT STRING whose contents are the value
   of the public key.  Here also the interpretation of the content
   differs from PQC algorithm to algorithm.

   For an NTRU private key, for example, the content needs to be
   interpreted according to the NTRUPrivateKey type and for an NTRU
   public key the content needs to be interpreted according to the
   NTRUPublicKey type; both are defined in the NTRU chapter below.

   The '90s' variants listed above differ in the symmetric primitives
   that are used internally.  By default, CRYSTALS-Kyber uses SHAKE-128
   as XOF, SHA3 for hashing and SHAKE-256 for PRF and KDF.  The '90s'
   variants use AES256CTR to construct a XOF and a PRF, SHA2 for hashing
   and SHAKE-256 as KDF.  The main advantage of the '90s' variants is
   that they benefit from the ready availability of hardware AES and
   SHA2 co-processors.  While the parameters listed in the table are the
   same, the key-pairs will not be compatible with the '90s' variants.

3.2.  Key Details

   Public key.  The public-key consists of two parameters:

   *  t: encoded vector A*s+e, where A is a public matrix over a
      constant-sized polynomial ring, s and e are vectors over the same
      ring.
   *  rho: public seed (32 bytes)

   The size necessary to hold all public key elements is 12*k*n/8+32
   bytes.  Private key.  The private key consists of 3 parameters:

   *  s: encoded sample from a centered binomial distribution B_{eta_1}
      (12*k*n/8 bytes)
   *  H(pk): hashed public key (32 bytes).  CRYSTALS-Kyber uses SHA3-256
      as H by default.  The '90s' variants use SHA256 instead.
   *  z: a nonce (32 bytes)

   If the private key is fully populated, it consists of 3 parameters.
   The size necessary to hold all private key elements accounts to
   12*k*n/8+64 bytes, not counting the optional public key.  The
   resulting public key and private key sizes are shown in the following
   table.

3.3.  Private Key Full Encoding

   Distributing a CRYSTALS-Kyber private key with PKCS#8 requires:

   *  kyber-(n*k)-r3 in the algorithm field of AlgorithmIdentifier
   *  KyberPrivateKey in the privateKey field, which is an OCTET STRING.

   When a CRYSTALS-Kyber public key is included in the distributed
   PrivateKeyInfo, the PublicKey field in KyberPrivateKey is used (see
   description of KyberPublicKey below).  The ASN.1 encoding for a
   CRYSTALS-Kyber private key is defined as follows:


   KyberPrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE {
       version     INTEGER {v0(0)}   -- version (round 3)
       s           OCTET STRING,     -- sample s
       publicKey   [0] IMPLICIT KyberPublicKey OPTIONAL,
                                     -- see next section
       hpk         OCTET STRING      -- H(pk)
       nonce       OCTET STRING,     -- z
   }

Internet-Draft      QSC Cryptography Key Information      September 2022


3.4.  Private key Partial Encoding

   The partially populated parameter set uses of the fact that some
   parameters can be regenerated.  In this case, only the initial seed
   'd' (nonce) is stored and used to regenerate the full key.  Partially
   encoded keys use the same ASN.1 structure as the fully polulated
   keys, simply with the regenerated fields set to EMPTY.  Compared to
   the approach of a single definition and setting the regenratable
   fields as OPTIONAL, this approach significantly simplifies the
   processing os ASN.1 frames and validation of the partial encoding.
   The ASN.1 format for the partially populated versions is the same as
   for the fully populated version.  The ASN.1 encoding for this variant
   (z replaced by d) is defined as follows:


   KyberPrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE {
       version     INTEGER {v0(0)}   -- version (round 3)
       s           OCTET STRING,     -- EMPTY
       publicKey   [0] IMPLICIT KyberPublicKey OPTIONAL,
                                     -- see next section
       hpk         OCTET STRING      -- EMPTY
       nonce       OCTET STRING,     -- d
   }


3.5.  Public Key Full Encoding

   The vector 't' is encoded using the function Encode_12, defined as
   the inverse of Decode_12 as defined in Algorithm 3 of the CRYSTALS-
   Kyber round 3 specification.  The size of t is 12*k*n/8 bytes.  The
   seed 'rho' is a 32 byte OCTET STRING.


   KyberPublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {
       t           OCTET STRING,
       rho         OCTET STRING
   }

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   Any processing of the ASN.1 private key structures, such as base64
   en/decoding shall be performed in "constant-time", meaning without
   secret-dependent control flow and table lookups.  The ASN.1
   structures in this document are defined with fixed tag-lengths.  The
   purpose is to prevent side-channel leakage of variable lengths during
   DER parsing.  Any DER parsing of the private key ASN.1 key structures
   shall be performed with these fixed lengths.
