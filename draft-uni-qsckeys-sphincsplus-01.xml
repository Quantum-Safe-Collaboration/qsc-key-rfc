        <abstract>
            <t>This proposal defines key management approaches for Quantum Safe Cryptographic (QSC) algorithms 
            currently under evaluation in the NIST Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) process.   
            This includes key identification, key serialization, and key compression. The purpose is to provide guidance such that 
            the adoption of quantum-safe algorithms is not hampered with the fragmented evolution of necessary key management standards. 
            Early definition of key material standards will help expedite the adoption of new quantum safe algorithms at the same time as improving interoperability between implementations and minimizing divergence across standards. </t>

            <name>Introduction</name>
            <t>QSC algorithms being standardized in the NIST PQC Process have evolved through several rounds and iterations. Keys are neither easily identifiable nor compatible across rounds. It is also expected that algorithms will evolve after final candidates have been selected.  The lack of binary compatibility between algorithm versions and variants means that it is important to clearly identify key material. Parallel to the NIST process, industry is evaluating the impact of adopting new PQC algorithms, in particular key management. Here it is important to define and standardize key serialization and encoding formats. Finally, we have seen that many platforms and protocols are very constrained when it comes to the amount of memory or space available for key objects.  This makes it important to define and standardize key compression formats. This proposal addresses aspects of key identification, key serialization, and key compression for NIST PQC candidates.</t>

                <name>Algorithm Identification</name>
                <t>Algorithm identification is important for several reasons: </t>
                <ul spacing="compact">
                    <li>Managing a smooth transition from early adoption algorithm versions to production versions where there is no compatibility.</li>
                    <li>Supporting different algorithm versions from different NIST rounds</li>
                    <li>Identifying different key serialization strategies </li>
                    <li>Identifying compressed and uncompressed keys</li>
                </ul>
                <t>The current standardization of quantum-safe algorithms does not address the definition of serialization structures for keys. As a result, it has become commonplace for the cryptographic community working on and with these algorithms to define their own approaches. This leads to proprietary and internal representations for key material. This has certain advantages in terms of ease of experimentation while focusing on finding the best-performing QSC algorithms. In terms of longer-term support where algorithm versions change this is a problem.
                    For the purpose of temporarily supporting ongoing experimentation with opaque blobs, for example in simple "classic key-emulating" test applications, such as TLS, this document specifies a temporary but suboptimal key format in section 2.1, mainly to establish a base of reference for as long as experimentation is ongoing. This is referenced as the 'raw key material' representation.
                    At the same time, this proposal documents in section 2.2 below, a long-term key representation format useful to address the goals outlined in 1.1. 
                    This proposal contains all information required to document and transition from one version of key material representation to another.</t>

                            <t>This RFC addresses key identification, key serialization, and key compression for the set of quantum safe algorithms currently under evaluation in the NIST PQC process. The aim of this RFC is to facilitate the management of key material as these algorithms evolve through standardization phases into production. Early definition of key material is expected to expedite the adoption of new quantum safe algorithms at the same time as improving interoperability and preventing diverging standards. </t>

        <!-- Change Log
    
    v00 2006-03-15  EBD   Initial version
    
    v01 2006-04-03  EBD   Moved PI location back to position 1 -
    v3.1 of XMLmind is better with them at this location.
    v02 2007-03-07  AH    removed extraneous nested_list attribute,
    other minor corrections
    v03 2007-03-09  EBD   Added comments on null IANA sections and fixed heading capitalization.
    Modified comments around figure to reflect non-implementation of
    figure indent control.  Put in reference using anchor="DOMINATION".
    Fixed up the date specification comments to reflect current truth.
    v04 2007-03-09 AH     Major changes: shortened discussion of PIs,
    added discussion of rfc include.
    v05 2007-03-10 EBD    Added preamble to C program example to tell about ABNF and alternative
    images. Removed meta-characters from comments (causes problems).
    
    v06 2010-04-01 TT     Changed ipr attribute values to latest ones. Changed date to
    year only, to be consistent with the comments. Updated the
    IANA guidelines reference from the I-D to the finished RFC.
    v07 2020-01-21 HL    Converted the template to use XML schema version 3.
