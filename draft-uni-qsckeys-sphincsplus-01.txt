                       QQSC Keys for Sphincsplus
                    draft-uni-qsckeys-sphincsplus-01

Abstract

   This proposal defines key management approaches for Quantum Safe
   Cryptographic (QSC) algorithms currently under evaluation in the NIST
   Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) process.  This includes key
   identification, key serialization, and key compression.  The purpose
   is to provide guidance such that the adoption of quantum-safe
   algorithms is not hampered with the fragmented evolution of necessary
   key management standards.  Early definition of key material standards
   will help expedite the adoption of new quantum safe algorithms at the
   same time as improving interoperability between implementations and
   minimizing divergence across standards.

1.  Introduction

   QSC algorithms being standardized in the NIST PQC Process have
   evolved through several rounds and iterations.  Keys are neither
   easily identifiable nor compatible across rounds.  It is also
   expected that algorithms will evolve after final candidates have been
   selected.  The lack of binary compatibility between algorithm
   versions and variants means that it is important to clearly identify
   key material.  Parallel to the NIST process, industry is evaluating
   the impact of adopting new PQC algorithms, in particular key
   management.  Here it is important to define and standardize key
   serialization and encoding formats.  Finally, we have seen that many
   platforms and protocols are very constrained when it comes to the
   amount of memory or space available for key objects.  This makes it
   important to define and standardize key compression formats.  This
   proposal addresses aspects of key identification, key serialization,
   and key compression for NIST PQC candidates.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] .

1.2.  Algorithm Identification

   Algorithm identification is important for several reasons:

   *  Managing a smooth transition from early adoption algorithm
      versions to production versions where there is no compatibility.
   *  Supporting different algorithm versions from different NIST rounds
   *  Identifying different key serialization strategies
   *  Identifying compressed and uncompressed keys

   The current standardization of quantum-safe algorithms does not
   address the definition of serialization structures for keys.  As a
   result, it has become commonplace for the cryptographic community
   working on and with these algorithms to define their own approaches.
   This leads to proprietary and internal representations for key
   material.  This has certain advantages in terms of ease of
   experimentation while focusing on finding the best-performing QSC
   algorithms.  In terms of longer-term support where algorithm versions
   change this is a problem.  For the purpose of temporarily supporting
   ongoing experimentation with opaque blobs, for example in simple
   "classic key-emulating" test applications, such as TLS, this document
   specifies a temporary but suboptimal key format in section 2.1,
   mainly to establish a base of reference for as long as
   experimentation is ongoing.  This is referenced as the 'raw key
   material' representation.  At the same time, this proposal documents
   in section 2.2 below, a long-term key representation format useful to
   address the goals outlined in 1.1.  This proposal contains all
   information required to document and transition from one version of
   key material representation to another.

1.3.  Algorithm and Algorithm Parameter Object Identifier

   Algorithm and algorithm parameter information shall have ASN.1 type
   AlgorithmIdentifier as given in [RFC5280] and shall be extended by an
   pqcAlgorithmParameterName type in the optional parameters field:

   AlgorithmIdentifier ::=  SEQUENCE {
       algorithm  OBJECT IDENTIFIER, - OID: algorithm and algo parameter
       parameters pqcAlgorithmParameterName OPTIONAL
   }
   pqcAlgorithmParameterName ::= PrintableString


2.  Acknowledgements

   This template was derived from an initial version written by Pekka
   Savola and contributed by him to the xml2rfc project.

   This document is part of a plan to make xml2rfc indispensable.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

4.  Security Considerations

   Any processing of the ASN.1 private key structures, such as base64
   en/decoding shall be performed in "constant-time", meaning without
   secret-dependent control flow and table lookups.  The ASN.1
   structures in this document are defined with fixed tag-lengths.  The
   purpose is to prevent side-channel leakage of variable lengths during
   DER parsing.  Any DER parsing of the private key ASN.1 key structures
   shall be performed with these fixed lengths.
